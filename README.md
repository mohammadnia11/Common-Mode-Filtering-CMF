# Common Mode Filtering for InSAR Time Series

This repository will host the code for the **Common Mode Filtering** method, developed to mitigate atmospheric effects in InSAR time series analysis. The method improves deformation measurements in small-scale areas (~16 kmÂ²) by reducing correlated noise and enhancing the detection of subtle geophysical signals.

## About the Method
The Common Mode Filtering approach is adapted from GNSS studies and has been successfully applied to InSAR data. It significantly reduces the standard deviation (STD) of uncorrected time series and, when combined with atmospheric corrections (e.g., ERA5), achieves up to 50% improvement in signal precision. This method is particularly effective for geohazard monitoring, including volcanic and tectonic studies.

## Code Availability
The code for this method will be uploaded here **after the associated research manuscript is accepted for publication**. Until then, this repository will serve as a placeholder with updates on the progress of the release.

## Citation
Once the manuscript is published, please cite the associated research article if you use this code in your work. Citation details will be added upon code release.
