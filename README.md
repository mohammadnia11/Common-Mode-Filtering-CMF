This repository will host the code for the **Common Mode Filtering** method, developed to mitigate atmospheric effects in InSAR time series analysis. The method improves deformation measurements in small-scale areas (~16 km²) by reducing correlated noise and enhancing the detection of subtle geophysical signals.

## About the Method
The Common Mode Filtering approach is adapted from GNSS studies and has been successfully applied to InSAR data. It significantly reduces the standard deviation (STD) of uncorrected time series and, when combined with atmospheric corrections (e.g., ERA5), achieves up to 50% improvement in signal precision. This method is particularly effective for geohazard monitoring, including volcanic and tectonic studies.
